`massSight` is a probabilistic method for **cross-study LC–MS feature matching** and **multi-study clustering**.

## Install

Install using `uv`:

```bash
uv add mass-sight
```

Or using pip:

```bash
pip install mass-sight
```

## Quickstart: match two studies

```bash
mass_sight match study_a.csv study_b.csv \
  --out-candidates candidates.csv \
  --out-top1 top1.csv \
  --ppm 15
```

- `study_a.csv` and `study_b.csv` are feature tables (CSV/TSV) with at least `feature_id`, `mz`, and `rt` columns.
- `candidates.csv` contains all possible feature matches with their probabilities.
- `top1.csv` contains the top 1 peak match between the two studies.
- `--ppm` specifies the mass accuracy tolerance in parts-per-million.
