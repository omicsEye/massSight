\title{Detect Adducts in Mass Spectrometry Data}
\usage{
detect_adducts(
  data,
  ppm_tolerance = 5,
  rt_tolerance = 0.1,
  ion_mode = "pos",
  adducts = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at least the columns \code{RT} (retention time in minutes) and \code{MZ} (mass-to-charge ratio).}

\item{ppm_tolerance}{Mass accuracy tolerance in parts per million (ppm) for matching mass differences. Default is 5 ppm.}

\item{rt_tolerance}{Retention time tolerance in minutes for considering peaks as potential adducts. Default is 0.1 minutes.}

\item{ion_mode}{Ionization mode, either \code{"pos"} for positive or \code{"neg"} for negative. Default is \code{"pos"}.}

\item{adducts}{Optional data frame of adduct definitions. If not provided, a default list of common adducts is used based on \code{ion_mode}.}
}
\value{
A data frame of potential adduct pairs with details of the matches.
}
\description{
This function identifies potential adduct pairs in mass spectrometry data based on mass differences and retention times.

# Detect adducts in positive mode
